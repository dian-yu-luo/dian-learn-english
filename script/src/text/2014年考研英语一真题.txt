As many people hit middle age, they often start to notice that their memory and mental clarity are not what they used to be.  We suddenly can’t  remember

    1     we put the keys  just a moment  ago,  or an old acquaintance’s name, or the  name of an old band we used to love. As the brain     2     ,  we  refer  to  these occurrences as “senior moments.”  3    seemingly  innocent, this loss of mental   focus can potentially have  a(n)   4    impact  on  our  professional,  social,  and personal      5      .

Neuroscientists, experts who study the nervous system, are increasingly showing that there’s actually a lot that can be  done. It   6     out that the brain  needs exercise in  much the  same way our  muscles do, and the  right  mental

    7     can significantly improve our basic cognitive     8   . Thinking is essentially a     9     of making connections in the brain. To a certain extent, our ability to       10    in  making  the  connections  that drive  intelligence is  inherited.

    11   , because these connections are made through effort and practice, scientists  believe   that  intelligence  can  expand   and  fluctuate    12     mental   effort.

Now,  a  new Web-based company  has  taken  it  a   step    13     and developed the first “brain training program” designed to actually help people improve and regain their mental    14    .

The  program  keeps   16    of  your  progress  and provides detailed feedback 17   your performance and improvement. Most importantly, it      18      modifies and enhances the games you play to      19      on   the  strengths  you  are  developing  –  much  like  a(n)   20   exercise  routine  requires you to increase resistance and vary your muscle use.

Text 1



In order to “change lives for the better” and reduce “dependency”, George Osborne, Chancellor of the Exchequer, introduced the “upfront work search”  scheme. Only if the jobless arrive  at the jobcentre with a CV,  register for online job search, and start looking for work will they be eligible for benefit –  and then they should report weekly rather than  fortnightly.  What  could  be  more  reasonable?

More apparent reasonableness followed. There will now be a seven-day wait   for the jobseeker’s allowance. “Those first few days should be spent looking for work, not looking to sign on,” he claimed. “We’re doing these things because we know they help people stay off benefits and help those on benefits get into work faster.” Help? Really? On first hearing, this was the socially concerned chancellor, trying to change lives for the better, complete with “reforms” to an obviously indulgent system that demands too little effort from the newly unemployed to find work, and subsidises laziness. What motivated him,  we  were to understand, was his zeal for “fundamental fairness” – protecting the taxpayer, controlling spending and ensuring that only the most deserving claimants received their benefits.

Losing a job is hurting: you don’t skip down to the jobcentre with a song in  your heart, delighted at the prospect of doubling your income from the generous state. It is financially terrifying, psychologically embarrassing and you know that support is minimal and extraordinarily hard to get. You  are  now not  wanted;  you are now excluded from the work environment that offers purpose and structure in your life. Worse, the crucial income to feed yourself and your family and pay the  bills has disappeared. Ask anyone newly unemployed what they want and  the  answer is always: a job.

But in Osborneland, your first instinct is to fall into dependency – permanent dependency if you can get it – supported by a state only too ready to indulge your falsehood. It is as though 20 years of ever-tougher reforms of the job search and benefit administration system never happened. The principle of  British  welfare  is no longer that you can insure yourself against the risk of unemployment and  receive unconditional payments if the disaster happens. Even the very phrase “jobseeker’s allowance” is about redefining the unemployed as a “jobseeker” who had no fundamental right to a benefit he or  she  has  earned  through  making national insurance contributions. Instead, the claimant receives a time-limited “allowance,” conditional on actively seeking a job; no  entitlement  and  no insurance, at £71.70 a week, one of the least generous in the EU.













	George Osborne’s scheme was intended to

	encourage jobseekers’ active engagement in job seeking.

	provide the unemployed with easier access to benefits.

	guarantee jobseekers’ legitimate right to benefits.

	motivate the unemployed to report voluntarily.



	The phrase “to sign on” (Line 3, Para. 2) most probably means

	to check on the availability of jobs at the jobcentre.

	to accept the government’s restrictions on the allowance.

	to register for an allowance from the government.

	to attend a governmental job-training program.



	What prompted the chancellor to develop his scheme?

	A desire to secure a better life for all.

	An eagerness to protect the unemployed.

	An urge to be generous to the claimants.

	A passion to ensure fairness for taxpayers.



	According to Paragraph 3, being unemployed makes one feel

	uneasy.

	insulted.

	enraged.

	guilty.



	To which of the following would the author most probably agree?

	Unemployment benefits should not be made conditional.

	The British welfare system indulges jobseekers’ laziness.

	The jobseekers’ allowance has met their actual needs.

	Osborne’s reforms will reduce the risk of unemployment.

All around the world,  lawyers  generate more hostility  than the members  of  any other profession – with the possible exception of journalism. But there are few places where clients have more grounds for complaint than America.

During the decade before the economic crisis, spending on legal services in America grew twice as fast as inflation. The best lawyers made skyscrapers-full of money, tempting ever more students to pile into law schools. But most law  graduates never get a big-firm job. Many of them instead become the kind of nuisance-lawsuit filer that makes the tort system a costly nightmare.

There are many reasons for this. One is the excessive costs of a legal education. There is just one path for a lawyer in most American states: a four-year undergraduate degree in some unrelated  subject,  then  a three-year law degree  at  one of 200 law schools authorized by the American Bar Association and an  expensive preparation for the bar exam. This leaves today’s average law-school graduate with $100,000 of debt on top of undergraduate debts. Law-school debt means that they have to work fearsomely hard.

Reforming the system would help both lawyers and their customers. Sensible ideas have been around for a long time, but the state-level bodies that govern the profession have been too conservative to implement them. One idea is to allow people to study law as an undergraduate degree. Another is to let students sit for  the bar after only two years of law school. If the bar exam is truly a stern  enough  test for a would-be lawyer, those who can sit it earlier should be allowed to do so. Students who do not need the extra training could cut their  debt  mountain  by a  third.

The other reason why costs are so high is the restrictive guild-like ownership structure of the business. Except in the District of Columbia, non-lawyers may not own any share of a law firm. This keeps fees high and innovation slow. There is pressure for change from  within  the profession, but opponents  of change among  the regulators insist that keeping outsiders out of a law firm isolates lawyers  from  the pressure to make money rather than serve clients ethically.

In fact, allowing non-lawyers to own shares in law firms would reduce costs   and improve  services to customers,  by encouraging law firms to use technology  and to employ professional managers to focus on  improving  firms’ efficiency.  After all, other countries, such as Australia and Britain, have  started  liberalizing their legal professions. America should follow.

		



	A lot of students take up law as their profession due to

	the growing demand from clients.

	the increasing pressure of inflation.

	the prospect of working in big firms.

	the attraction of financial rewards.



	Which of the following adds to the costs of legal education in most American states?

	Higher tuition fees for undergraduate studies.

	Receiving training by professional associations.

	Admissions approval from the bar association.

	Pursuing a bachelor’s degree in another major.



	Hindrance to the reform of the legal system originates from

	the rigid bodies governing the profession.

	lawyers’ and clients’ strong resistance.

	the stern exam for would-be lawyers.

	non-professionals’ sharp criticism.



	The guild-like ownership structure is considered “restrictive” partly because it

	prevents lawyers from gaining due profits.

	bans outsiders’ involvement in the profession.

	aggravates the ethical situation in the trade.

	keeps lawyers from holding law-firm shares.



	In this text, the author mainly discusses

	the factors that help make a successful lawyer in America.

	a problem in America’s legal profession and solutions to it.

	the role of undergraduate studies in America’s legal education.

	flawed ownership of America’s law firms and its causes.

The US$3-million Fundamental Physics Prize is indeed an interesting experiment, as Alexander Polyakov said when he accepted this year’s award in March. And it is far from the only one of its type. As a News Feature article in  Nature discusses, a string of lucrative awards for researchers have joined the Nobel Prizes in recent years. Many, like the  Fundamental  Physics Prize, are  funded from the telephone-number-sized bank accounts of Internet entrepreneurs.These benefactors  have  succeeded  in their  chosen fields,  they say, and they want  to use their wealth to draw attention to those who have succeeded in science.

What’s not to like? Quite a lot, according to a handful of scientists quoted  in  the News Feature. You cannot buy class, as the old saying goes, and these upstart entrepreneurs cannot buy their prizes  the prestige of the Nobels. The new awards   are an exercise in self-promotion for those behind them, say scientists. They could distort the achievement-based system of peer-review-led research. They could cement the status quo of peer-reviewed research. They do not fund peer-reviewed research. They perpetuate the myth of the lone genius.

The goals of the prize-givers seem as scattered as the criticism. Some want to shock, others to draw people into science, or to  better  reward  those  who  have  made their careers in research.

As Nature has pointed out before, there  are some legitimate  concerns about  how science prizes  – both  new  and  old  – are distributed. The Breakthrough Prize in Life Sciences, launched this year, takes an  unrepresentative  view  of  what  the life sciences include. But the Nobel Foundation’s limit  of  three  recipients  per  prize, each of whom must still be living, has long been outgrown by  the  collaborative nature of modern research – as  will  be  demonstrated  by  the inevitable row over who is ignored  when it comes to acknowledging the discovery  of the Higgs boson. The Nobels were, of course, themselves set up by a very rich individual who had decided what he wanted to do with  his  own  money.  Time, rather than intention, has given them legitimacy.

As much as some scientists may complain about the new awards, two things seem clear. First, most researchers would accept such a prize if they were offered one. Second, it is surely a good thing that the money and attention come to science rather than go elsewhere. It is fair to criticize and question the mechanism– that is the culture of research, after all – but it is the prize-givers’ money to do with as they please. It is wise to take such gifts with gratitude and grace.









	The Fundamental Physics Prize is seen as

	a symbol of the entrepreneurs’ wealth.

	a handsome reward for researchers.

	a possible replacement of the Nobel Prizes.

	an example of bankers’ investments.



	The critics think that the new awards will most benefit

	the profit-oriented scientists.

	the achievement-based system.

	the founders of the new awards.

	peer-review-led research.



	The discovery of the Higgs boson is a typical case which involves

	legitimate concerns over the new prizes.

	controversies over the recipients’ status.

	the joint effort of modern researchers.

	the demonstration of research findings.



	According to Paragraph 4, which of the following is true of the Nobels?

	History has never cast doubt on them.

	Their endurance has done justice to them.

	They are the most representative honor.

	Their legitimacy has long been in dispute.



	The author believes that the new awards are

	unworthy of public attention.

	subject to undesirable changes.

	harmful to the culture of research.

	acceptable despite the criticism.



































Text 4



“The Heart of the Matter,” the just-released report  by the American Academy  of Arts and Sciences (AAAS), deserves praise for affirming the importance of the humanities and social sciences to the prosperity and security of liberal democracy     in America. Regrettably, however, the report’s failure to address the true nature of  the crisis facing liberal education may cause more harm than good.

In 2010, leading congressional Democrats and Republicans sent letters to the AAAS asking that it identify actions that could be taken by “federal, state and local governments, universities, foundations, educators, individual benefactors and others” to “maintain national excellence in  humanities  and  social  scientific  scholarship  and education.” In response, the American Academy formed  the  Commission  on the Humanities and Social Sciences. Among the commission’s 51 members are top-tier-university presidents, scholars, lawyers,  judges,  and  business  executives,  as well as prominent figures from diplomacy, filmmaking, music and journalism.

The goals identified in the report are generally admirable. Because representative government presupposes an informed citizenry, the report supports  full literacy; stresses the study of history and government, particularly American history and American government; and encourages the use of new digital technologies. To encourage innovation and competition, the  report  calls  for increased investment in research, the crafting of coherent curricula that improve students’ ability to solve problems and communicate  effectively  in  the  21st century, increased funding for teachers and the encouragement of scholars to bring their learning to bear on the great challenges of the day. The report also advocates greater study of foreign languages, international affairs and the expansion of study abroad programs.

Unfortunately, despite 21/2 years in the making, “The Heart  of  the  Matter” never gets to the heart of the matter: the illiberal nature of liberal education at our leading colleges and universities. The commission ignores that for several decades America’s colleges and universities have produced graduates who don’t know the content and character of liberal education and are thus deprived of  its  benefits. Sadly, the spirit  of inquiry  once at home  on campus has been replaced  by the use   of the humanities and social sciences as vehicles for publicizing “progressive,” or left-liberal propaganda.

Today, professors routinely treat the progressive interpretation of history and progressive public policy as the proper subject of study while portraying conservative or classical liberal ideas – such as free markets and self-reliance –  as  falling outside the boundaries of routine, and sometimes legitimate, intellectual investigation. 

The AAAS displays great enthusiasm for liberal education. Yet its report may well  set back reform by obscuring the depth and breadth of the challenge that Congress asked it to illuminate.









	According to Paragraph 1, what is the author’s attitude toward the AAAS’s report?

	Critical.

	Appreciative.

	Contemptuous.

	Tolerant.



	Influential figures in the Congress required that the AAAS report on how to

	define the government’s role in education.

	safeguard individuals’ rights to education.

	retain people’s interest in liberal education.

	keep a leading position in liberal education.



	According to Paragraph 3, the report suggests

	an exclusive study of American history.

	a greater emphasis on theoretical subjects.

	the application of emerging technologies.

	funding for the study of foreign languages.



	The author implies in Paragraph 5 that professors are

	supportive of free markets.

	conservative about public policy.

	biased against classical liberal ideas.

	cautious about intellectual investigation.



	Which of the following would be the best title for the text?

	Ways to Grasp “The Heart of the Matter”

	Illiberal Education and “The Heart of the Matter”

	The AAAS’s Contribution to Liberal Education

	Progressive Policy vs. Liberal Education

	Some archaeological sites have always been  easily observable – for example,  the Parthenon in Athens, Greece; the pyramids of Giza in Egypt; and the megaliths of Stonehenge in  southern England.  But  these  sites  are  exceptions to the norm. Most archaeological sites have been located by means of careful searching, while many others have been discovered by accident. Olduvai Gorge, an early hominid site in Tanzania, was found by a butterfly hunter who literally fell into its deep valley in 1911. Thousands of Aztec artifacts came to light  during the digging of the Mexico City subway in the 1970s.



	In another case, American archaeologists René Million and George  Cowgill spent years systematically mapping the  entire  city  of  Teotihuacán  in  the Valley of Mexico near what is now Mexico City. At its peak  around AD  600, this city was one of the largest human  settlements  in  the  world.  The researchers mapped not only the city’s  vast  and ornate ceremonial areas, but  also hundreds of simpler apartment complexes where common people lived.



	How do archaeologists know where to find  what they are looking for  when  there is nothing visible on  the surface of  the ground? Typically,  they  survey  and sample (make test excavations on) large areas of  terrain  to  determine  where excavation will yield useful information. Surveys and test samples have also become important for understanding the larger landscapes that contain archaeological sites.



	Surveys can cover a single large settlement or entire landscapes. In one case, many researchers working around the ancient Maya city of Copán, Honduras, have located hundreds of small rural villages  and  individual  dwellings  by  using aerial photographs and by making surveys on foot. The resulting  settlement maps show how the distribution and density of the rural population around the city changed dramatically between AD 500 and 850, when Copán collapsed.







		



	To find their sites, archaeologists today rely heavily on systematic survey methods and a variety of high-technology tools and techniques. Airborne technologies, such as different types of radar and photographic equipment  carried by airplanes or spacecraft, allow  archaeologists  to  learn  about  what  lies beneath the ground  without  digging. Aerial  surveys  locate  general  areas of interest or larger buried features, such as ancient buildings or fields.



	Most archaeological sites, however, are  discovered  by  archaeologists  who  have set out to look for them. Such searches can take  years.  British archaeologist Howard Carter knew that the tomb of the Egyptian pharaoh Tutankhamun existed from information found in other sites. Carter  sifted  through rubble in the Valley of the  Kings  for  seven  years before  he  located  the tomb in 1922. In the late 1800s British archaeologist Sir Arthur Evans combed antique dealers’ stores in Athens, Greece. He was searching for tiny engraved seals attributed to the ancient Mycenaean culture that dominated  Greece from the 1400s to 1200s BC.  Evans’s  interpretations  of  these engravings eventually led him to find the Minoan palace at Knossos (Knosós),  on the island of Crete, in 1900.



	Ground surveys allow archaeologists to pinpoint the places where digs will be successful. Most ground surveys involve a lot of walking, looking for surface clues such as small fragments of pottery. They often  include a  certain amount  of digging to test for buried materials at selected points across a landscape. Archaeologists also may locate buried remains by using such technologies as ground radar, magnetic-field recording, and metal detectors. Archaeologists commonly use computers to map sites and the  landscapes around  sites. Two-  and three-dimensional maps are helpful tools in planning excavations,  illustrating how sites look, and presenting  the  results  of  archaeological research.

Music means different things to  different  people  and  sometimes  even  different things to the same person at different moments of his life. It might be  poetic, philosophical, sensual, or mathematical, but in any case it must, in my view, have something to do with the soul of the human being. Hence it is metaphysical; but the means of expression is purely and exclusively  physical:  sound. I believe it is precisely  this  permanent  coexistence  of  metaphysical message through physical means that is the strength of music. (46) It is also the reason why when we try to describe music with words,  all we can do is  articulate  our reactions to it, and not grasp music itself.

Beethoven’s importance in music has been principally defined by the revolutionary nature of his compositions. He freed music from hitherto prevailing conventions of harmony and structure. Sometimes I feel in his late works a will to break all signs  of continuity. The music is abrupt  and  seemingly  disconnected, as  in the last piano sonata. In musical expression, he did not feel restrained by the weight of convention. (47) By all accounts he was a freethinking person, and a courageous one, and I find courage an essential quality for the understanding, let alone the performance, of his works.

This courageous attitude in fact becomes a requirement for the performers of Beethoven’s music. His compositions demand the performer to show courage, for example in the use of dynamics. (48) Beethoven’s habit of increasing the  volume with an extreme intensity and then abruptly following  it  with  a  sudden  soft  passage was only rarely used by composers before him.

Beethoven was a deeply political man in the broadest sense of the word.  He  was not interested in daily politics, but  concerned  with  questions  of  moral  behavior and the larger questions of right and wrong affecting the entire society.

(49) Especially significant was his view of freedom,  which,  for  him,  was associated with the rights and responsibilities of the individual: he advocated freedom of thought and of personal expression.

Beethoven’s music tends to move from chaos to order as if order were an imperative of human existence. For him, order does not result from forgetting or ignoring the disorders that plague our existence; order is a necessary development, an improvement that may lead to the Greek ideal of spiritual elevation. It is not by chance that the Funeral  March is not the last movement of the Eroica  Symphony,  but the second, so that suffering does not have the last word. (50) One  could  interpret much of the work of Beethoven by saying that suffering is inevitable, but the courage to fight it renders life worth living.

 这也解释了为什么当我们试图用语言去描述音乐的时候，充其量只能是说清楚自己的感受，而无法抓住音乐本身。



  总而言之，他是一个思想不受束缚的人，而且是一个富有勇气的人。我认为勇气是理解——更是演奏——其作品不可或缺的品格。



 贝多芬惯以超凡的力度加大音响，随后突然进入一个意想不到的柔和乐段，这种手法在前人的作品中极为罕见。



 尤具深意的是他的自由观，在他看来自由关系到个人的权利和责任：他主张思想和个人表达的自由。
